    You can install the project by two ways. You can unpack the archive or clone the project from the github using the
link_______________.In both cases, I added the database file db.sqlite3. You don't have to waste time making migrations, creating database tables,
and users. The necessary account tiers (Basic, Premium, Enterprise), as well as users(username corresponds to account tier)
 have already been created in the database and the admin panel. You can log in admin panel by credentials:
 username = 'admin', password = 'Test1234'. You can also use those user's credentials for making requests:
 username = 'basic_user', 'premium_user', 'enterprise_user', password for each of them is 'Test1234'
